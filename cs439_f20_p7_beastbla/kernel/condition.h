// A Mesa-style condition variable
//    - protected by a mutual exclusion lock. The lock protocol is:
//          * lock()
//          * unlock()
//          * isMine(): returns true if the lock is held by the caller but:
//                            allows false positives. false => not held by the caller.
//                                                    true => may or may not be held by the caller
//                            makes no atomicity guarantees
//
//    - wait() can have false postivies: can return even though the conditioned hasn't been signalled
//             and doesn't make owner guarantees
//

    //
    // Why do we allow false positives (return without being signalled and/or allow
    // the state to change after you've been signalled)?
    //
    //     -   We implement Mesa-style monitors in which the lock is not
    //         transfered from the signaller to the waiting thread. This
    //         means that when a thread wakes up in wait, it has to reacquire
    //         the lock. This gives a chance to other threads to enter the
    //         monitor and mess with the state.
    //
    //         We can implement lock transfer and tighten that condition but:
    //
    //             - we decided below not to hold a lock across the context switch
    //
    //             - lock transfer can lead to subtle programming errors when
    //               the caller of signal forgets that the lock is lost
    //
    //         This also makes us immune against software that generates false notifies.
