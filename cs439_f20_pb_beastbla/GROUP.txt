-- Should be identical for all group members --

- What did the group plan on doing?
    In milestone 2, our goal is to implement write, remove, and rename for file system
    , and write the corresponding system calls. Also, we plan to implement the structure
    of the journal.

- What did the group end up doing?
    We finish our plan and finish:
    write(), removeFile(), renameFile() in class ext2
    write(), remove(), rename() in sys.cc
    journal structure in journal.h

- What worked?
    write(), remove(), rename() in class ext2
    write(), remove(), rename() in sys.cc
    functions in ext2 and system calls work very well

- What didn't work?
    journaling do not work for now, but we will finish it in milestone 3.

- How can we compile/run your code?
    We have two repos since the makefiles for syscall and ext2 are different.

    *For testing file system, please run the following command:
    cd cs439_f20_testFS_yijing/
    ./run_qemu testFS

    *For testing system call, please run the following command:
    cd cs439_f20_testSymCall_beastbla/
    ./run_qemu testFS
