* How many sectors are read while running t0?

  `412

* Read about journaled file systems and log structured file systems and
  explain why we have them

  `A journaled file system keeps a journal of the changes that are being made to the file system.
  In order to keep consistency of file system, We can use journals to rapidly reconstruct corruptions 
  when system crash or power outage.
  `A log structured file system is a file system in which data and metadata are written sequentially 
  to a circular buffer. It enables to write efficiently because of sequential writes and the redundant writes
  are avoided.

* Why do we need both hard links and symbolic links?

  `Both hard links and symbolic links are two different method to refer to a file.
  A hard link refers directly to the inode of a file. Therefore, if you change file via hard link,
  the original file is changed.
  A symbolic link is a shortcut that refers directly to the file which refers to the inode
  , instead of inode itself. 
  A sysblic links can lin kto directories which the hard link can't.
  When you delete a target file, symbolic links to that file become unusable
  , whereas hard links preserve the contents of the file.
  They have different special usage, and that's why we need both of them.
