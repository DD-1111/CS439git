- What did you plan on doing this week?
We plan to implement write in ext2, remove and rename for our OS.
We plan to implement some parts of journal.
- What did you actually do?
    write(), removeFile(), renameFile() in class ext2
    write(), remove(), rename() in sys.cc
    journal structure in journal.h
    For jounral, most of the functions are still not implemented, and the structure for meta-data
and functionality of it are still not sure.
- What worked?
    write(), remove(), rename() in class ext2
    write(), remove(), rename() in sys.cc
    functions in ext2 and system calls work very well
- What didn't work?
    Journal is not working(not done yet). The demonstration of journal will be little bit difficult,
since the write in the environment of the qemu can not actually change the file outside, we can not 
simulate a crash and recover, I personally believe we can just print out all the commit in order to show
that we do have a journal for the content that actually change the filesystem.


- What did you learn?
The implement of entries function in ext2 use a high level design that can update multiple parameters passed into 
the lamida, now I completely understand the design for the code provided to us, so I wrote the rename and write functions that
doing perfectly well in beastbla directory. Then I finish the corresponding sysCalls, which is relatively simple.
 
- In your optinion, what percentage of the work was done by each group member?
Yijing 50%, Diyuan 50%.
