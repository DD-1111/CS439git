-- Should be identical for all group members --

- What did the group plan on doing?

    File system writing and journaling.

- What did the group end up doing?

    First, we will implement some write functions in file system. 
    Planned write functionï¼š write() create() unlink()
    Then, we will implement journaling.
    journalWrite(), JournalCreate(), JournalUnlink();
 

- What worked?

    nothing work so far since we are at designing stage. 
    We've learnt a lot about how journal works and how to implement write.
    We did lots of research at this stage and made a slide for presentation.

- What didn't work?

    nothing work so far since we are at designing stage.
    Since for every write action will be written into journal first, if we understand this correctly, 
    we will need to modify the blockIO interface and other possible interface interacting with hardwares.
    Also, we are concerned about how to make a demo using what we have now. (since we don't have a shell or 
    input devices and the writing processes are fast and not crashing the system) 


- How can we compile/run your code?

    we will write detailed instruction in next milestone. 
    we will provide several test case to show the journal we implemented works.
