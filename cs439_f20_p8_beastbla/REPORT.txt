* How many sectors are read while running t0?
I read 909 - 87 = 822 times sectors, which is not quite good I believe. There are a lot of tiny things
I can optimize but I don't really have that time.

* Read about journaled file systems and log structured file systems and
  explain why we have them
 Those file system have recovery capability. Because the update information for directories and 
 bitmaps is always written to a continuous disk before the original disk log is updated So 
 it guarantees the integrity of the data. When a system error occurs, a full-log 
 file system will ensure that the data on the disk is restored to the state before the 
 system crash.

* Why do we need both hard links and symbolic links?
Firstly, when we are mounting on some devices, because there is no way to access the mounted devices
through hard links, so symbolic links are needed. When a file is removed, the symbolic links will become
dangerous and invalid, they are dangling and potentially point to different file even with same name inside of the links.
Also, the main advantage of hard links is no size or speed penalty compared to symbolic links.
