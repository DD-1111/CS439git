- What did you plan on doing this week?
I implemented the inner structure of the journal and other basic functions of the journal. 

- What did you actually do?
I designed a inner structure inside of journal, which is a circular buffer, which will automatically delete previous data while the journal is kind of "full"
(which means the new transaction will make it goes out of the fixed size).Then I made the functions of buffering, second time writing, basicly txcommit, Jwrite and check things.
Basicly, I did pretty much the whole implementation of logic of our journal system. 
I also made a sysCall to show the journal.

- What worked?
The inner structure of circularbuffer worked, committing to the journal worked, all the things I mention above worked. 

- What didn't work?
But because we are using a using emulator, when we write to our fs, we can not actually store the data outside of the emulator, otherwise, 
we will be happy to do a demo of a power cut and fix errors in file system caused by that using our journal.

- What did you learn?
I actually learn a lot, like I got completely understanding of the file system, then I design the suitable structure according to the IO interface we have for the current code we have.
Now I know the logic of system recovery, and how to improve that journal's efficiency (by changing it to logical logging structure to avoid two times writing).

- In your optinion, what percentage of the work was done by each group member?
Diyuan Dai 55%, Yijing Chen 45%
