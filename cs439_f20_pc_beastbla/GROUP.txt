-- Should be identical for all group members --

- What did the group plan on doing?

    We planed to implement class Transaction and TransactionQueue, and Journal.
    Also, we planed to write several journaling functions to make it work.

- What did the group end up doing?

    We finished Journaling and it works very well.
    Now, We have class Transaction and TransactionQueue, and Journal.
    In class Journal, we implemented redo(), checkQueue(), checkConsistency(), txCommit(), Jwrite()
    We wrote a test case to show our works.

- What worked?

    We are able to init a transaction to store info, such as inumber, offset, nbytes, buffer.
    Also, inner structure of journal is a queue and it works very well too.
    For journal, we can keep tracks each Blockio::write_all() call and make corresponding commit(aka. transactions).


- What didn't work?

    We have not successfully malloc a block in inode for journal block.

- How can we compile/run your code?

    cd testJournal
    cd t0.dir/sbin
    make
    cd ../..
    make clean -s test
    Then, you will get the output in t0.raw

- ..
