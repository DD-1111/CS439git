In your opinion:

- What should your participation score be (0-10)? explain
I believe I can have a participation score for 8. Because of the time zone problem, I can not attend live class,
 (although I do pay a lot of attention and efforts on the recordings) so I really treasure those opportunities to have conversation and discussion with all my talented classmates and TAs,
 That is why I do use a lot of piazza, and take part in the discussion. Although I feel like my answers or sugguestions may not be that helpful to others, I still try to understand others' posts
 and take part of those. I would like to say thank you to all of my talented classmates and TAs, some of them are anonymous, I do feel grateful and touched while getting help from others. I have 
 never thought like a CS class can make me interact so much, and we are doing it remotely!!! Like before this class, I felt to act as a unused node in a garbage collector, now some pointers are 
 pointing me, and also I am pointing others. Thank y'all for giving me such an impressive experience.

- What overall letter grade do you deserve in this class? explain
I believe I deserve a B- in this class. 
I am sorry that I can not handle all of my courses very well this semester. I overestimated myself at the beginning of the semester and I am taking 331 439 and 375 at the same time.
 This class is the most challenging one I have ever had and I have learned a lot so far. I really like this class but I just feel bad that I don't have enough time and that capability 
 to handle it well. I struggle between giving it up then take it again next semester or keep going with a poor grade. I talked to several TAs, and they are very helpful and give me encouragement 
 and some valueble advice.  In the first several weeks, I felt so frustrated because all of my  3 cs classes seem very difficult for me and I was thinking about quitting OS because I was doing pretty bad on this class and failing assignments. I have to say that, not like some other
  classmates, I am not talented in CS at all. However, I did not quit and I keep making effort until now because each time when I solve the problems and see my code works, making progress,
  I just feel good. 

 I almost failed 3 projects at the first half of the semester, I have to be honest that I am not getting used to the semester at all. But later on, I started to have my own pace and I found that I can gradually catch up a little bit now, 
 though I am still relatively bad in this class. I did put as much efforts I can in this class, so no matter what grade I actually get, I will accept it with a happy face. In my perspectives,
 I have challenged myself a lot and to be honest, I feel so proud of myself that I can accomplish all of my classes under such a difficult situation. 

I am so sorry to make such an inconvenience because of my ignorance and the stupid decision I made while registering. Thank you all for all your patience and helping me make it. At the end of semester,
looking through what I learned and what I have experienced, I have to say that I really enjoy the whole process and will remember this impressive class, which pushed me a lot and made me gain a lot.
